It should return the payout averaged over those `n_runs`.\n\nThen, once the function is defined, in order to estimate the average slot payout, we need only call the function.\n\nBecause of the high variance of the outcome (there are some very rare high payout results that significantly affect the average) you might need to run your function with a very high value of `n_runs` to get a stable answer close to the true expectation.  For instance, you might use a value for `n_runs` of 1000000.\n\nHere's an example for how the function could look:\n```python\ndef estimate_average_slot_payout(n_runs):\n    # Play slot machine n_runs times, calculate payout of each\n    payouts = [play_slot_machine()-1 for i in range(n_runs)]\n    # Calculate the average value\n    avg_payout = sum(payouts) / n_runs\n    return avg_payout\n    \nestimate_average_slot_payout(10000000)\n\n```\n\nThis should return an answer close to 0.025!\n            \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Keep Going\n\nMany programmers report that dictionaries are their favorite data structure.
